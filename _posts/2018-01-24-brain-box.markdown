The Brain Box is a complete "DIY" compute module for controlling a small-scale grow environment, gathering data, and optimizing environmental variables. It is a 21st century version of the classic environmental controller that was originally developed for indoor cannabis cultivation (and greenhouse agriculture).

This project was inspired by the [OpenAg Brain Box](https://github.com/OpenAgInitiative/openag_brain_box).
